# Repeating a Module - What to Expect

The code challenges at the end of modules 1 through 4 are designed for two
purposes: to expose students to the sorts of challenges they can expect when
interviewing for jobs, and to identify students who do not fully grasp the
critical concepts from a module. Because the topics we cover in each module
are vital to your success through the remainder of this course and as a future
web developer, we rely on the results of these challenges as a standardized way
to determine if students will need to repeat a module.

### What does it mean to repeat a module?

You will need to repeat a module in the event that you do not pass the first
and second code challenges. Repeating means that you will be expected to
participate in lectures and projects as well as review and re-complete assigned
labs. Your instructor may also have more specific guidance and reviews
depending on what you need to focus on.

While it can be disappointing to have to leave your cohort for another, please
remember that you are here to gain the skills necessary to be successful as a
web developer. The time during this course is an opportunity to focus
specifically on becoming as good as possible in this skill and it is to your
benefit to take the time you need to fully understand the concepts.

### I feel like I understand what was taught, I just made some mistakes during the challenge. I get nervous during tests

Test taking, working under pressure and time constraints are their own skills.
However, part of the purpose of these challenges is to expose students to the
sort of structure that you may face during job interviews. The best way to
address this is two-fold: one, make sure students take extra time to become
more proficient on the topics so that even under time constraints they are able
to comfortably solve a code challenge and two, take more code challenges to get
more comfortable working under pressure. Repeating a module fulfills both of
these and is the fairest way to make sure that each student is fully equipped to
be successful post-graduation.

### I understand most of what was taught in the module, I just need to review one part, not repeat the entire three weeks.

Depending on the outcome of your challenge, your instructors may give you
specific projects or review certain concepts to help cover any gaps in
understanding. However, repeating module topics you already grasp will still
be beneficial to you. Working on a topic you understand is an opportunity for
you to help teach your peers and improve your technical communication
abilities, which are both hugely valuable on a real development team.

### What should I do differently if I am repeating?

Because of the limited time we have and the amount of topics we need to cover
in this 15 week course, it is impossible for a student to fully master any of
the topics we cover. Repeating coursework will only strengthen your
understanding and better equip you later on.The purpose of this course is to
not only teach students web development skills, but to teach the skills
necessary for self-learning. Repeating is a great opportunity to review and
reflect on what methods worked best for you in terms of understanding concepts.

Try different techniques - building side projects works for some as a way to
solidify concepts, but not others; watch lecture videos if you have not before;
try writing a blog post on a particularly challenging concept from the module.
Consider repeating as a chance to review not only the module topics but your
methods for learning.
